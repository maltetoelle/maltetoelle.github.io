 <p>Welcome to my site! My name is Malte Tölle, currently I am a masters student at Leibniz University Hanover pursuing degrees in biomedical and classical mechanical engineering. Though my field of studies is a bit different, I am into programming. My interests lie within Machine Learning and Computer Vision mostly in the medical imaging domain. Sometimes, I try myself at developing web pages.</p>
