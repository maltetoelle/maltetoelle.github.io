I am a PhD student in computer science at Ruprecht-Karls-University Heidelberg under the supervision of Jun. Prof. Sandy Engelhardt in the group Artificial Intelligence in Cardiovascular Medicine (AICM). I also hold a degree in Economics. My research in computer science focusses on connecting university hospitals to enable privacy-preserving federated learning with multi-modal data. I employ Bayesian methods to enhance reliability and robustness of the used machine learning models. The tools learned in computer science were employed in my thesis in economics to enhance forecasting of macroeconomic models more precisely a New Keynesian Model.

This is my personla website, where you can find my CV, publications, and posts about general topics I'm interested in.
